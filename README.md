- Hi, I’m @mjablons1
- I learn therfore I am.
- I’m interested in instrumentation, mobile networks, sound egineering, electroacoustics, field recording, growing cucumber (just kidding).
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to sound egineering, measurement instrumentation and scientific projects.
- I code in Python and Erlang.
